angular-rest-springsecurity
===========================

An demo AngularJS Application that uses a Spring Security protected REST backend.

This demo is based on, and includes large chunks of, the expertly written code at https://github.com/philipsorst/angular-rest-springsecurity

I refactored it a bit to use Spring Boot and Java configuration wherever possible.
